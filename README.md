## **Description** ##
Groovasana is a task maangement web application that was designed thinking of neurodiverse minds. It helps users organize their day with clarity and flow by breaking todos into smaller sub-tasks, assigning pre-defined categories, and using a clean, pastel aesthetic for stress-free planning.

## **Background** ##
This project was built as part of my bootcamp with General Assembly. I wanted to create a tool that not only organizes todos, but also reduces overwhelm with a soft, yoga-inspired UI and features tailored to ADHD-friendly workflows.

## Next Steps ##
Groovasana will always have room to grow! Here are some planned enhancements:

- Monthly Summary: A motivational end-of-month recap, inspired by Spotify's Spotify Wrapped, highlighting completed tasks and milestones as a reward system for users
- Inline Subtask Editing: Rather than having a separate page for editing subtasks, replace it with a JavaScript event listener, allowing users to update subtasks directly on the todo detail page for a smoother workflow.
- Repeatable To Dos: Introduce recurring tasks for building daily routines or habit tracking
- Integrated Timer: Add a built in timer on the todo details page, synced with each todo's estimated time field to support time management, accountability, and reduce time blindness.
UI/UX Enhancements: Refine CSS to better align with the original wireframes (see Trello board) and improve overall visual consistency.
