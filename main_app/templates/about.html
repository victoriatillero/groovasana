    <h2>Welcome to Groovasana — a task management app made for minds that move differently. </h2>

<p>I created Groovasana because traditional productivity tools never quite fit. They felt too rigid, too cold — like I was expected to force my brain into someone else's mold. <br> <br> But neurodiverse minds don’t thrive in boxes.  We thrive in rhythm, flow, and flexibility. </p>
<hr />
<h3> Groovasana is a name rooted in that idea:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> “Groove” for getting into a rhythm that feels natural and empowering </li>
    <li>“-asana” like in yoga — the postures we use to ground ourselves, soften our chaos, and find clarity</li>
</ul>
<hr>
This app isn’t about doing more. <br> It’s about doing what matters, in a way that feels sustainable, self-aware, and maybe even a little soothing.

<br>Wherever you fall on the spectrum — Groovasana is here to help you:
 <ul>
    <li> ✨ Break tasks into manageable pieces </li>
    <li>🧘 Find your own pace and flow </li>
    <li> ✅ Build systems that actually support your brain </li>
    <li> 🌿 Feel a little more ease as you move through your day </li>
</ul>
<br>
No pressure.  No perfectionism. <br>
Just one breath, one task, one groove at a time. <br><br>
<b>Because organizing your mind shouldn’t feel like a fight- </b> It should feel like... <i> relief </i>. </p>

    <p>One stretch goal i have for this site is to also be able to add pics to your completed tasks (almost) like an accountability pal, and we can do 'spotify wrapped' style, but maybe by month and also by the year?</p>
